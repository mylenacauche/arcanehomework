# Arcane Homework

## Init Environment

### This project is a Flask API Rest and the following steps are about initializing the environment of the project. The command line you need to write begins with ~$.

### First, install Python 3 and Flask if you don't have them on your desk.
### You'll find Python on Python.org. Verify it is well installed :
#### ~$ python --version
#### ~$ pip --version


### Install Flask :
#### ~$ pip install Flask

### Use the dependency manager Pipenv to isolate the project on private environments :
#### ~$ pip install pipenv

## Init Project

### TODO: create git repository, then git clone project from github
### Move into the project directory. Then create the virtual environment and install flask on the project.
### ~$ pipenv --three
### ~$ pipenv install flask
